hubris:
  excessive pride or self-confidence
  arrogance

We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
laziness, impatience, and hubris. ... Hubris is excessive pride, the sort
of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and
maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.
Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer.

<<<>>>

specious:
  apparently good or right but lacking real merit
  superficially pleasing or plausible

I find the inertia argument, "You've spent N years using X and now you know
it so well that switching cannot be worth it.", quite specious.

<<<>>>

foist:
  to impose fraudulently or unjustifiably
  to introduce surreptitiously or fraudulently 
  to force upon

Since the integers are a subset of the real numbers, the distinction
between them is wholly artificial — foisted on us by hardware designers.

<<<>>>

myopic:
  shortsighted, narrow-minded
  unable or unwilling to act prudently
  lacking tolerance or understanding

If you don't have the ability to "see the forest for the trees" you treat

mountweazel:
  fake entry in a dictionary or encylcopedia to catch copyright violators

It was an old tradition in encyclopedias to put in a fake entry to protect
your copyright. If someone copied Mountweazel, then we’d know they’d stolen
from us.

prosaic:
  ordinary, dull, tedious, unimaginative
  more like prose than poetry

You see, I am a very prosaic, unromantic, sensible sort of fellow
myself; and I have always had my heart set on finding the most
sensible, prudent, level-headed wife in the world.

Jane Austen

It never ceases to amaze me how prosaic, pedestrian, unimaginative
people can persistently pontificate about classical grammatical
structure as though it's fucking rocket science. These must be the
same people who hate Picasso, because he couldn't keep the paint
inside the lines and the colors never matched the numbers.

apocryphal:
  of doubtful authenticity, spurious

Parson Weems account of George Washington and the cherry is considered

rebarbative:

<<<>>>

attenuate:
  to weaken
  to reduce in force, intensity, effect, quantity, or value

Both in lying and in telling the truth people are guided by their beliefs
concerning the way things are. For this reason, telling lies does not tend
to unfit a person for telling the truth in the same way that bullshitting
tends to. Through excessive indulgence in the latter activity a person's
normal habit of attending to the way things are may become attenuated or
lost.

<<<>>>

sanction:
  to authorize, approve, or allow
  authoritative permission or approval, as for an action

There is a tendency among older C programmers to write macros instead of

sanctioned examples.

sang-froid:
  coolness of mind, calmness, composure
  self-possession; poise, equanimity, self-control
  nerve, courage, steadiness

In his writing Assange is quick to lash out at perceived enemies. By
contrast, on television he acts with uncanny sang-froid. This impression is
magnified by his rigid demeanor and his baritone voice, which he deploys
slowly, at low volume.
